# AntiClaimHop

## What is claim hopping?
Claim Hopping is a term dubbed in Towny Servers; where a player hits another player and immediately returns to their town to avoid any damage. This could make it impossible to kill another player while they kill you.

## Why use this plugin?
AntiClaimHop was developed for EarthPol in 1.16.5 after many issues with the unnecessary bloatware that was the SirBlobman's CombatLogX that came with 3 additional jars just to get the basic function to load. In addition, this software caused many issues because it tracked Player Movements, not once but twice. Rather than just checking hits and because of this, it could bring a server down to its knees with any combat that involved more than 10 people. This plugin tracks hits and does not cause unnecessary lag to your server while it tries to prevent re-entry into a claim.

## What is different?
In this plugin the following changes occur.
  - One Jar with Drag and Drop install.
  - Removes durability damage to armor to gear in Arenas.
  - Removes Cobweb placing during combat.
  - Punishes players for logging out during combat.
  - Prevents access to commands besides ("tc", "nc", "g", "ally", "msg", "r", "reply", "tell", "pm", "mod", "admin", "combattag", "lc")
  - Prevents opening an ender chest while in combat (mitigates stacking more than an inventory of potions)
  - Removes the ability to use Riptide while in combat.

There are two versions, a SiegeWar compatible one and a regular Towny use one.
